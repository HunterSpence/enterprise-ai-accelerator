## [0.5.0] -- 2026-06-12

The v0.4.0 release moved the model IDs to Fable 5 but kept Opus 4.6-era request
shapes -- three of which Fable 5 rejects or silently degrades. v0.5.0 completes
the migration: every call path is now on the June-2026 API surface, with refusal
resilience and model-aware budgeting on top. **Zero new runtime dependencies.**

### Fixed -- Fable 5 API correctness (production-breaking before this release)
- `core/ai_client.py`, `core/streaming.py`, `core/interleaved_thinking.py` -- the
  legacy `thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}` shape returned **HTTP 400
  on every Fable 5 call** (the flagship thinking path was non-functional in v0.4.0).
  All paths now use adaptive thinking; depth is controlled via `output_config.effort`.
- Annex IV reasoning traces were **silently empty** on Fable 5 (thinking display
  defaults to omitted). All audit-trail paths now send
  `thinking={"type": "adaptive", "display": "summarized"}` -- the summarized trace
  is what gets persisted as Article 12 evidence (the raw chain of thought is never
  returned by the API on Fable 5).
- `ThinkingResponse.thinking_tokens` was incorrectly populated from
  `cache_read_input_tokens`; thinking spend is folded into `output_tokens` by the
  API and the field now reports 0 (kept for backward compatibility).
- `core/models.py` -- `CTX_WINDOW_SONNET_4_6` corrected to 1M (was 200K; Sonnet 4.6
  has a 1M window).
- `docs/FABLE_5_UPGRADE.md` -- corrected Opus 4.7 pricing ($5/$25, not $15/$75),
  the fabricated `claude-opus-4-7-20250514` ID, and the inverted "Fable 5 is
  cheaper than Opus 4.7" claim.

### Changed -- structured outputs replace forced tool calls
- `AIClient.structured()` / `structured_with_thinking()` now use **structured
  outputs** (`output_config.format` with a JSON schema): generation is constrained
  server-side so the response text is guaranteed-valid JSON, and -- unlike forced
  `tool_choice` -- the mechanism is compatible with thinking, which is always on
  for Fable 5. `tool_name`/`tool_description` parameters are retained as no-ops.
- Schemas are normalized automatically (`additionalProperties: false` injected
  recursively). `migration_scout`'s open-map `evidence_weight` schema was rewritten
  as an `{attribute, weight}` array (strict-mode compatible) and folded back into a
  dict after parsing.
- Default `max_tokens` raised to 16,000 on non-streaming calls (adaptive thinking
  spends from the same cap; 1-2K ceilings starve it) and 64,000 on streaming.

### Added -- refusal resilience (server-side fallbacks)
- Fable 5 safety classifiers can decline a request as a *successful* HTTP 200 with
  `stop_reason: "refusal"`. The client now (1) routes Fable 5 calls through the
  server-side fallbacks beta so a refusal is retried on **Opus 4.8 in the same
  round trip** (`MODEL_FALLBACK`, env-overridable; kill-switch
  `EAA_ENABLE_FALLBACKS=0`), and (2) raises a typed `RefusalError` (with
  `stop_details` category/explanation for the audit trail) when the whole chain
  declines. `StructuredResponse.served_by_fallback` reports when a fallback model
  produced the answer. Graceful degradation on providers that reject the beta.
- `core/interleaved_thinking.py` -- handles `refusal` (typed error) and
  `pause_turn` (server-tool resume) stop reasons in the agentic loop.

### Added -- effort-aware routing + model-aware budgets
- `core/models.py` -- `EFFORT_LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/XHIGH/MAX`, `effort_for_budget()`
  translation, `MODEL_FALLBACK`, beta-header constants
  (`BETA_SERVER_SIDE_FALLBACK`, `BETA_TASK_BUDGETS`, `BETA_COMPACTION`), capability
  helpers (`is_fable`, `supports_effort`, `supports_adaptive_thinking`), and
  max-output-token reference values. `describe_model()` now reports adaptive
  thinking, effort, structured outputs, always-on-thinking, and refusal capability.
- `core/model_router.py` -- `route_decision()` returns a `RoutingDecision`
  (model + recommended effort). Routing fixes: long-context tasks (>400K) now route
  to **Sonnet 4.6** (same 1M window as Fable 5 at 30% of the input price), and
  Haiku-eligible task kinds that exceed Haiku's 200K window are promoted to Sonnet
  instead of overflowing.
- `agent_ops/orchestrator.py` -- pipelines run under `max_tokens_budget` now also
  pass an **API-native task budget** (`output_config.task_budget`, beta, min 20K)
  so the model sees a running countdown and self-moderates -- complementing
  BudgetGuard's hard client-side abort.
- `AIClient.count_tokens()` -- model-specific token counting via the
  count_tokens endpoint (never tiktoken).

### Deprecated
- `THINKING_BUDGET_*` constants and every `budget_tokens` / `thinking_budget`
  kwarg -- still accepted, translated to the nearest effort level with a
  `DeprecationWarning`. Removal targeted for v0.6.0.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-10

Six parallel capability tracks: model refresh to Claude Fable 5, a first-party offline eval
harness with a CI gate, a first-party guardrail layer, MCP Streamable HTTP + audited tool
calls, compliance currency to June 2026 law (11 frameworks), and a governance/pricing
documentation pack. **Zero new runtime dependencies** — evals and guardrails are first-party
code; `mcp>=1.27.0` (already a runtime requirement) is now correctly declared in
`pyproject.toml`.

### Changed — Model Refresh + Packaging (W1)
- `core/models.py` — `MODEL_FABLE_5 = "claude-fable-5"` is the flagship/coordinator model, overridable via `EAA_FLAGSHIP_MODEL`; `MODEL_OPUS_4_7` retained as a deprecated alias resolving to Fable 5 so existing imports keep working; Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5 worker tiers unchanged
- `core/model_router.py` + `core/cost_estimator.py` — pricing tables updated to June 2026 list prices: Fable 5 $10/$50 per MTok (cache read $1, cache write $12.50, batch −50%), Sonnet 4.6 $3/$15, Haiku 4.5 $1/$5
- Stale model-ID strings updated across `core/`, `cloud_iq/`, `finops_intelligence/`, `agent_ops/`, `observability/` (Grafana cost dashboard re-priced), `.env.example` (was two generations stale), and module READMEs
- `pyproject.toml` — version 0.4.0; `mcp>=1.27.0` added to dependencies (was missing — clean installs could not start the MCP server); `anthropic>=0.69.0,<1.0`; pytest `testpaths` now includes all six test directories (per-module suites were silently excluded)
- **Fixed:** `cloud_iq` demo mode made live (billable) API calls — demo mode now never calls the Anthropic API; the two affected tests pass offline
- `cloud_iq/models.py` — Pydantic V1 `@validator` migrated to V2 `@field_validator`
- `finops_intelligence/README.md` — FOCUS 1.4 (June 2026, AI token-economics columns) noted on roadmap; exporter remains FOCUS 1.3-conformant
- **Tokenizer caveat (corrected in v0.5.0):** Fable 5 shares the Opus 4.7/4.8-era tokenizer; counts are roughly unchanged vs Opus 4.7/4.8. The ~35% inflation applies only when comparing against pre-Opus-4.7 (Sonnet/Haiku-era) measurements -- pre-v0.4.0 benchmark token counts and dollar figures remain stale for that reason. See `docs/FABLE_5_UPGRADE.md`.

### Added — Eval Harness + CI (W2)
- `evals/` — first-party, offline-first eval harness (no third-party eval dependency): JSONL golden datasets (`six_r_classification` 23 cases, `iac_policy_detection` 20 cases incl. true-negatives, `prompt_injection_redteam` 25 cases), deterministic scorers, per-suite thresholds, JSON + markdown reports
- The IaC suite scores the real `iac_security.PolicyEngine`: F1 0.894 against a 0.85 gate at release
- `python -m evals.run --offline` exits non-zero below threshold — wired into CI as a quality gate
- Optional live mode (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, `--offline` omitted) runs 6R golden cases through the real model path
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — first CI for the repo: full offline test suite + the eval gate on every push/PR
- `evals/tests/` — 40 harness self-tests

### Added — Guardrails + Orchestrator Hardening (W3)
- `core/guardrails.py` — first-party `GuardrailEngine` with input rail (prompt-injection detection: instruction-override, role-smuggling, suspicious encodings, unicode direction/zero-width tricks, tool-arg smuggling), output rail (secret/PII redaction), execution rail (tool allowlists + call caps); `BudgetGuard` (per-run token/USD caps); `GuardedAIClient` wrapper; mapped to OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 in the module docstring; 77 offline tests
- `agent_ops/orchestrator.py` — exponential-backoff retries on transient API errors; per-run token/cost budgets via `BudgetGuard` with clean partial-results abort; stage checkpoints persisted to `.eaa_checkpoints/` with `Orchestrator.resume(run_id)`; optional human-in-the-loop `approval_handler` gate with auto-approvals recorded in result telemetry; 52 new tests

### Changed — MCP Modernization + Security (W4)
- `mcp_transports.py` — Streamable HTTP transport added via the official SDK (`StreamableHTTPSessionManager`, endpoint `/mcp`) per MCP spec 2025-03-26; SSE retained but labeled legacy; stdio unchanged as default
- Bearer-token auth on both network transports via `EAA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (constant-time compare; `/health` exempt; stdio exempt)
- Every MCP tool invocation is appended to the platform's own Merkle chain (`.eaa_audit/mcp_tools.db`): tool name, SHA-256 of args, duration, status — fail-open, default on, opt-out via `EAA_MCP_AUDIT` (OWASP MCP08)
- Argument validation before dispatch: path-traversal rejection, enum and numeric-bounds checks, clean MCP errors (OWASP MCP03/05)
- `tests/test_mcp_server.py` — 26 new tests (transports, auth, audit chain, validation); 74 total passing

### Added — Compliance Currency + ML-BOM (W5)
- `policy_guard/` — **Colorado SB 24-205 was repealed**; coverage added for its replacement **SB 26-189** (signed May 14, 2026, effective Jan 1, 2027) and for **Texas TRAIGA** (effective Jan 1, 2026; penalties $10K–$200K per violation) — 15 controls each. Framework count: 9 → 11, cross-framework traceability updated
- `ai_audit_trail/chain.py` — the placeholder blockchain anchor is gone; replaced by a real `AnchorBackend` protocol with `FileAnchor` (append-only, fsync'd, thread-safe) and `WebhookAnchor` (POST with retry) implementations
- `ai_audit_trail/web_ui.py` — NIST AI RMF MANAGE 2.2 (human-oversight events from the audit chain) and GOVERN 5.2 (third-party AI inventory from the ML-BOM + model registry) implemented; TODO markers removed
- `iac_security/` — CycloneDX 1.7 **ML-BOM** generation: `python -m iac_security mlbom` emits machine-learning-model components for the platform's model stack (provider, version, API ID)
- EU AI Act timeline updated to the Digital Omnibus reality: high-risk (Annex III) enforcement December 2, 2027 (deferred from August 2, 2026); GPAI obligations in force since August 2025

### Added — Documentation (W6)
- `GOVERNANCE.md` — solo maintainer model, decision process, release cadence, security report handling, bus-factor mitigation, contribution acceptance criteria
- `PRICING.md` — OSS Core (free); Accelerator Cloud ($299–$799/mo, roadmap); Enterprise Self-Hosted Support ($25K–$80K/yr); Fixed-Scope Services ($15K–$50K); FinOps outcome pricing (10% of realized savings, month 6); 3-year TCO contrast vs Big-6
- `ROADMAP.md` — NOW / NEXT / LATER horizon buckets with per-item rationale and status
- `docs/FABLE_5_UPGRADE.md` — v0.4.0 model refresh reference: Fable 5 pricing, tokenizer caveat, Opus 4.8 alternative, migration guide; `docs/OPUS_4_7_UPGRADE.md` carries a deprecation banner
- `docs/EU_AI_ACT_EVIDENCE_PACK.md` — Annex IV evidence walkthrough; Articles 9–15 mapped to platform commands and artifacts; Digital Omnibus timeline (high-risk: Dec 2, 2027)
- `docs/SOVEREIGN_DEPLOYMENT.md` — all computation in the client's cloud; Anthropic API as sole external call; no telemetry; air-gap notes; Bedrock/Vertex routing flagged as unconfirmed options to evaluate
- `README.md` — full rewrite: problem-first positioning, verifiability table, lock-in answer, time-to-value quickstart, pricing, corrected regulatory dates
- `docs/RESUME_TALKING_POINTS.md` — removed from the repository (interview-preparation content does not belong in a product repo)
